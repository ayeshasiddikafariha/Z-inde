    <h3 style="text-align: left;color:gray;">HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.Think of HTML as the abstract text and images behind a web page, CSS as the page that actually gets displayed, and JavaScript as the behaviors that can manipulate both HTML and CSS.</h3>

      HTML and CSS are the two most fundamental programming languages used in web development. Without them, we would not have websites.
